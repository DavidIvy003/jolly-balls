# Jollyballs Rules and Customs

![](jb.gif)

## **Objective**:
Teams of three compete to win the best two out of three games, or three out of five (players should come to a consensus about number of games before beginning the match). Games are concluded when a team reaches seven points except in the following cases:  
* If one team reaches five points before their opponent is able to score, and the other team has had a chance to serve, they have skunked their opponent and the game ends.  
* If both teams have six points, the game will be extended, requiring the winner to win by two points. The game will continue until one team has two points more than the other team, regardless of the score.

This is a game of the people, meaning that this is to be a civil game so that all may have a jolly time.

## Choosing teams:
The first player to call for a match of Jollyballs shall be the first captain. The player who seconds the notion shall be the second captain. Selecting players will then occur in the form of a Snake draft. The first captain drafts a single player, the second drafts two players, and then the remaining undrafted player joins the first captain's team.

## Choosing which team serves first:
Before each game in the series, each team places their paddles on the table with their paddle handle hanging off the edge. Two paddles should be placed on the corner and the third paddle should be centered on the table.

One team will toss the jollyball at the other team's paddles. If the first player hits the padding of the paddle, then the other team has a chance for a rebuttal. In the event that the player of the second team hits the paddle or handle, the second team will be first to serve. If the first player hits the handle of any of the second team's paddles, or hits two paddles in one shot, then it will be their ball first.

In the event that every player on each team has had a chance to shoot, the rebuttal is suspended and the first team to hit a paddle wins.

*Note: If a player's elbow extends past the edge of the table, they forfeit their toss, giving the ball to the other side.*

## How to Play:
The team who won the initial toss will start with the ball. The person in the center of the table will act as the server and will serve as though they were playing ping pong (the ball must hit the paddle then the server's side of the table before going over the net). As is the case with ping pong, a let is grounds for a re-serve.

The receiving team must let the ball bounce on their side before passing the ball to a teammate. When the ball crosses the net, it cannot be immediately returned and must be hit by at least two players before being returned. The ball can be returned after two or three touches, but cannot exceed three or it will result in the loss of the ball/point.

##Blocks
Any shot, slam, poke, or hit can be blocked, with the exception of a serve. A shot can be blocked or deflected back to the side that hit the ball without the need for a pass and will count as a live ball. A block does not count against the three maximum touches and a player may allow immediately hit the ball after blocking. nor does it count against the team that hit it.

*What is a Block?*
A block is defined as the defensive player extending his/her paddle and holding it out on his/her side of the net with hopes to deflect the shot.  A block may move horizontally along the net and vertically above the net, but not towards the net, or else it is not considered a block and results in a fault.

If the paddle of the blocker is hit while attempting to block a shot, it counts as his/her deflection and will count against the blocker if it goes off the table.  If any part of the blocker is over the table and hit while blocking, the ball is live and the responsibility the individual whom was hit.  

##Scoring
Jollyballs operates on side-out scoring, meaning that only the team that serves can score a point. If the team who received the serve is unable to return the ball to the table in the allotted number of touches, the team who serves receives a point. If the team who served faults, or the other team prevents them from returning the ball, the receiving team now is
in possession of the ball and rotates positions clockwise.

## Additional Rules:
* In Jollyballs, all surfaces, with the exception of the floor are live. If the ball hits off the wall, ceiling, tabletop, or any other nearby surface; the ball is playable.

* A player may hit the ball off of their body but cannot carry, toss, or throw the ball.

*Note: This can be both a disadvantage for those with low hanging ceiling fixtures and an advantage for those who have walls nearby.*

* No part of a player's body may extend past the net unless the player is hitting the ball backward to a teammate. In the event that a player is called offsides, that team is at fault and loses that possession.

* Jollyballs is a friendly game, wherein the event there is not a line judge present, disputed points or actions are decided by all players on the table. In the event that this ruling is not already present in the rules, the players will come to a collective conclusion to continue with the game. At the conclusion of the match, the dispute is posted in the slack channel and decided on by a majority vote.

*Note: This is meant to be fun, don't be a douche. When in doubt, redo the play, as the ball does not lie.*

## End of Game:
At the conclusion of the game, players of both sides line up and shake hands. This is an expected and time-honored tradition.
