# Jolly Balls
Official documentation for the official made-up sport of Ai

## Objective
Teams of three compete to win the best two out of three games, or three out of five, with each game going until one team wins. This is a game of the people, meaning that this is to be a civil game so that all may have a jolly time.

## How to Start
Before each game in the series, each team places their paddles on the table with their paddle handle hanging off the edge. Two paddles should be placed on the corner and the third paddle should be centered on the table.

One team will toss the jollyball at the other team's paddles. If the first player hits the padding of the paddle, then the other team has a chance for a rebuttal. In the event that the player of the second team hits the paddle or handle, the second team will be first to serve. If the first player hits the handle of any of the second team's paddles, then it will be their ball first.

*If a player's elbow extends past the edge of the table, they forfeit their toss, giving the ball to the other side.*

## How to Play:
The team who won the initial toss will start with the ball. The person in the center of the table will act as the server and will serve as though they were playing ping pong (the ball must hit the paddle then the server's side of the table before going over the net). As is the case with ping pong, a let is grounds for a re-serve.

The receiving team must let the ball bounce on their side before passing the ball to a teammate. When the ball crosses the net, it cannot be immediately returned and must be hit by at least two players before being returned. The ball can be returned after two or three touches, but cannot exceed three or it will result in the loss of the ball/point.

In the event of a slam, the ball can be blocked or deflected back to the side that slammed without the need for a pass. A block or deflection does not count against the three maximum touches, nor does it count against the team who slammed. However, if a block is hit back to the team who slammed the ball, that team has to return the ball, as the ball is live.

*While we observe the Supreme Court's opinion of "You know a slam when you see one," a good rule of thumb is "a flick of the wrist" is a slam.*

Jollyballs operates on rally scoring, meaning that only the team that serves can score a point. If the team who received the serve is unable to return the ball to the table in the allotted number of touches, the team who serves receives a point. If the team who served faults, or the other team prevents them from returning the ball, the receiving team now is 
in possession of the ball and rotates positions clockwise.

## Additional Rules
In Jollyballs, all surfaces, with the exception fo the floor are live. If the ball hits off the wall, ceiling, tabletop, or any other nearby surface; the ball is playable.

*This can be both a disadvantage for those with low hanging ceiling fixtures and an advantage for those who have walls nearby.*

No part of a player's body may extend past the net unless the player is hitting the ball backward to a teammate. In the event that a player is called offsides, that team is at fault and loses that possession.

Jollyballs is a friendly game, wherein the event there is not a line judge present, disputed points or actions are decided by all players on the table. In the event that this ruling is not already present in the rules, the players will come to a collective conclusion to continue with the game. At the conclusion of the match, the dispute is posted in the slack channel and decided on by a majority vote.

*This is meant to be fun, don't be a douche. When in doubt, redo the play, as the ball does not lie.*

## End of Game
At the conclusion of the game, players of both sides line up and shake hands. This is an expected and time-honored tradition.
