# Review Process and Rule Change

## To Propose a Rule/Rule Change:
To propose a new rule or a change to an existing rule, a player should first branch off of the master branch.  After creating a new branch, submit your new rule or rule change via a pull request for feedback and review by fellow Jolliers.  If at least 5 Jollyball admins come to a consensus on the rule change and have incorporated the feedback listed in the new suggestion, it may be merged into the Master branch.

*Note: Proposed Rule changes will be tested in actual games before being incorporated into the official rules.*
